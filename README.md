### Project Overview

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to uncover insights from complex datasets through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. Key goals include identifying patterns, correlations, and outliers, as well as enhancing data quality and consistency.

### Objectives

- Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess datasets, handling duplicates, missing values, and outliers.
- Visualization: Use plots like scatter plots, bar charts, and box plots to explore data distribution, relationships, and trends.
- Modeling & Analysis: Apply regression, correlation, and least squares analysis to determine optimal functions and patterns across data points.

### Solution Approach

- Data Cleaning: Removed outliers, duplicates, and missing values to ensure dataset integrity.
- Data Analysis: Leveraged Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, SQLAlchemy) for statistical methods, function mapping, and ideal function identification.
- Database Management: Utilized SQLite with SQLAlchemy for structured data storage and retrieval.

### Key Outcomes

The EDA project aids in preparing data for predictive modeling and decision-making, offering a comprehensive view of dataset structure and dependencies. By understanding relationships and data distributions, the project supports more accurate and meaningful analysis for future applications.
